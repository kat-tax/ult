/**
 * restyleForInlineText.tsx
 *
 * When a ULT component appears as a child of an Ult.Text, it needs to be styled
 * specially so that it appears inline with the text rather than introducing line
 * breaks.
 *
 * This utility restyles the component that is passed to it as inline so it flows
 * with the text. When a ULT component is a child of a text, pass the return value
 * of its render method to this utility. See Ult.View for an example.

    We'll use display: inline-block for inline element because
    inline-flex will introduce new lines into the text that is
    copied to the clipboard. In most our use-cases inline-block
    is fine and should behave same as inline-flex.

    Example:
    <flex>
      <inline> // InlineView
      <inline text node>
      <inline-flex> // set by this function - will introduce new line when copied
        <inline transparent text with emoticon text representation>
        <inline-block sprite clipping element>
        <inline-block sprite background texture>
      <inline text node>

    result into selection: "[text node][transparent text][new line][text node]"
    with inline-block this will properly resolve as "[text node][transparent text][text node]"
